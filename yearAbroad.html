    <p>
      In my <b>third year</b> of BSc Computer Science at the <b>University of Leicester</b>, I spent an academic year abroad at the
      <b>Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam)</b> in the Netherlands.
      This exchange has been an incredible opportunity to explore new learning environments, collaborate internationally,
      and apply my technical and creative skills in unique ways.

        <h3>🤖 Robot Interaction</h3>
        <p>
          In the <b>Robot Interaction</b> course, I explored how humans and robots communicate both socially and functionally.
          The course introduced concepts such as multimodal communication, human-centered AI, and the design of assistive robotic systems.

    <h3>💡 Project Spotlight: Robot Interaction Hackathon</h3>
    <p>
      A key highlight of this course was my participation in the <b>Robot Interaction Hackathon</b>,
      where I collaborated with teammates to develop an interactive scenario using the <b>NAO humanoid robot</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We designed and programmed a simulation in which NAO assisted an <b>elderly person</b> by reminding them to
      <b>take their medication</b>, guiding them to where it was located, and <b>checking whether the medication
      had been taken</b> through dialogue and motion interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project allowed me to merge my interests in <b>AI-driven interaction design</b> and <b>human-computer communication</b>,
      while tackling real-world applications in <b>healthcare and assistive technology</b>.
      It also helped refine my teamwork and problem-solving skills as we worked within time constraints to deliver
      a natural and engaging robot behavior.

  <h3>🧠 Knowledge and Data (K&D)</h3>

  <p>
    This course focuses on formalisms for representing knowledge and data, particularly for reuse and publication
    on the web. Key topics include the Semantic Web stack (RDF, RDFS, OWL), the SPARQL query language, and
    building data science pipelines that integrate data and knowledge for analysis and visualization.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the milestone assignment, I worked on a <b>group project</b> where I designed an ontology to structure
    and represent the knowledge. The project required creating an initial draft of the final report including
    preliminary results for the first version of the data analysis pipeline, two datasets (one RDF, one non-RDF),
    and a conceptual ontology design.
  </p>

  <p>
    The analysis was aimed at stakeholders who needed structured, queryable knowledge to support decision-making.
    Competency questions were formulated to ensure the knowledge graph and visualization pipeline met their needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also identified an external ontology to reuse, along with RDF and non-RDF datasets to populate the graph,
    and defined a preliminary methodology, domain, and scope. The ontology conceptualization included at least
    10 classes, 5 properties, and 2 restrictions, laying the foundation for the group project’s data analysis pipeline.

      <h4>📌 Ontology Design</h4>
      <p>
        I contributed by designing the ontology for our group project, defining key classes, properties, and
        restrictions to structure the integrated data effectively for SPARQL queries and pipeline analysis.
